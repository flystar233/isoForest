# isoForest
The isoForest package is a simple replication of the Isolation Forests algorithm for outlier detection, and the [ranger](https://github.com/imbs-hl/ranger) package is used to truly construct the forests.
In addition, the visualization of outliers is also implemented to help better observe the prediction results.
